# vector_inputs

Modify create_inputs.sh for your case. Submit script using:

`sbatch create_inputs.sh`

Some stardard grids may already be created here:

`/scratch2/NCEPDEV/land/data/ufs-land-driver/vector_inputs`

 set parameters for grid generation

 `atm_res`      : fv3 grid resolution [C48,C96,C192,C384,C768,C1152]
 `ocn_res`      : ocean resolution [mx500,mx100,mx050,mx025]
 `grid_version` : fix file options [hr3] (only "hr3" for now)
 `fixfile_path` : top level path for fix files, e.g., "/scratch1/NCEPDEV/global/glopara/fix/orog/"
 `grid_extent`  : grid options [global,conus] (for now, only a hard-coded conus option is available)

Outputs in current directory `atm_res`.`ocn_res` (C96.mx100 example):

`ufs-land_C96.mx100_hr3_corners.nc` : 
* contains lat/lon of grid centers and corners organized in vector
* vector is organized from tile 1 to 6 starting in lower-left corner with x-dimension faster-varying

`ufs-land_C96.mx100_hr3_static_fields.nc` :
* contains fix file inputs put into vector format, a necessary input for the ufs-land-driver

`ufs-land_C96.mx100_hr3_SCRIP.nc` :
* contains SCRIP "unstructured" format information used for ESMF regridding

`ufs-land_C96.mx100_hr3_SCRIP_veg.nc` :
* contains SCRIP "unstructured" format information for vegetated grids used for ESMF regridding
* this and the following two are used for regridding vectors between resolutions

`ufs-land_C96.mx100_hr3_SCRIP_bare.nc`   :
* contains SCRIP "unstructured" format information for bare grids used for ESMF regridding

`ufs-land_C96.mx100_hr3_SCRIP_snow.nc`   :
* contains SCRIP "unstructured" format information for snow grids used for ESMF regridding
