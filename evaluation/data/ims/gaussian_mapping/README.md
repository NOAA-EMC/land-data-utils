The ncl scripts are used to create prototype and hr mapping files for use of regridding ims nsow cover fraction into gaussian grid.

The scripts can be run in interactive mode or bash script. However, create_pt_ims1km_mapping_hr.ncl cannot complete its run in 8 hours maximum limit. It is needed to run create_pt_ims1km_mapping_hr.ncl interactively.
