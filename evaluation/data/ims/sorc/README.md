(1) The code regrid_ims_cgrid.f90 is to regrid IMS 1km and 4km data to one dimensional vector. The regridded data is for use of land DA output and ufs-landonly simulations.

(2) The code regrid_ims_cgrid_gassian.f90 is to regid IMS 1km and 4km data into 2D gaussian grid data for hr and prototype experiemnets.
