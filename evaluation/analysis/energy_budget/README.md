# energy_budget

Collection of scripts and instructions for analyzing and displaying energy budget terms for land surface components.

- energy_fluxes_timeseries.py: generate time series of energy fluxes at an individual land point for the ufs-land-driver simulations;

- heat_fluxes_timeseries.py: generate time series of heat fluxes and related variables at an individual land point for the ufs-land-driver simulations;
